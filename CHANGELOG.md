CHANGELOG
=========

5.3.10
 - Updated the AIR & Unity plugins to be more modular. That means that in both of them the code is not bundled any more into one big class or file, but split into multiple classes / files, such as SAAIRBannerAd, SAUnityVideoAd, etc. This not only spearates concerns but also makes it more manageable and easier to spot errors.
 - The AIR & Unity plugins can now override the main SDK version & sdk type. Meaning that when bundled as part of any of those SDKs, the Android SDK will report as "air_x.y.z." or "unity_x.y.z" instead of "android_x.y.z". This makes reporting so much more accurate. 


5.3.9
5.3.8
 - Made the Video ad close button invisible by default. Developers will now actively have to enable it in our SDK. In historical cases where this has been a problem it will mean an increased VCR rate.
 - Refactored the way the SDK works with default values. A default "SDK state" is now stored by the main SuperAwesome singleton. This dictates banner background color, default orientation, whether the close button is visible or not on video and all types of default values for everything that is customizable.
 - Refactored the AIR & Unity plugins to be more robust and do more error checking and to use default values in case any of the plugins don't somehow send values.
 - Refactored the MoPub plugin to be more robust and do more error checking.
 - Updated dependencies

5.3.7
 - Fixed another issue with SABannerAd and the background color - namely that at the start, unless calling mybanner.setColor(true/false) the banner background color would be the old color.

5.3.6
 - Updated SABannerAd and SAInterstitialAd background colors to 224, 224, 224 

5.3.5
 - Added generic setters for each of the properties needed to configure loading & playing for banners, interstitials, videos and app wall
 - Banners:
   - load parameters: test mode, configuration (production or staging)
   - play parameters: parental gate, background color
 - Interstitials:
   - load parameters: test mode, configuration (production or staging)
   - play parameters: parental gate, orientation (any, portrait, landscape)
 - Videos:
   - load parameters: test mode, configuration (production or staging)
   - play parameters: parental gate, orientation (any, portrait, landscape), close button, auto close, small click button
 - App Wall:
   - load parameters: test mode, configuration (production or staging)
   - play parameters: parental gate

5.1.0
- Added SAAppWall as a new ad format that's supported by the SDK

5.0.0
