If you haven't already registered your app on the SuperAwesome Dashboard, you can do that by going to [http://dashboard.superawesome.tv](http://dashboard.superawesome.tv) and creating a new app.

Once your app is created, or if you already had an app registered, the app ID is shown in the dashboard page (as highlighted above). You can customise your ad placements on this site and add features such as fallback placements.
