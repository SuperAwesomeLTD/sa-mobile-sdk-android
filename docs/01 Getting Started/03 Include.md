Once you've integrated the SuperAwesome SDK, you can access all functionality by importing the SuperAwesome class:

```
import tv.superawesome.sdk.SuperAwesome;

```

Additionaly you can also include other classes from the SDK package:

```
import tv.superawesome.sdk.activities.SAVideoActivity;
import tv.superawesome.sdk.models.SAAd;
import tv.superawesome.sdk.views.video.SAVideoViewListener;

```

But these should be automatically included by Android Studio for you.
