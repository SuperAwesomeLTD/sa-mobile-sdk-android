The gamewall allows a publisher to make additional revenue from users installing and engaging with third-party apps. These apps reward the user with virtual currency for the app they were directed from, thus increasing retention for the publisher as well as providing revenue.
Because of the way these rewards work, it is essential that your app has a virtual currency of some form that the user can be rewarded with.

Currently we can only provide gamewalls for Android apps, though iOS will soon be supported too.
